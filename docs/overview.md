# Project Overview

- **Name:** Radiant Picks (`next-ecom`)
- **Purpose:** A production-oriented, single Next.js ecommerce application serving the Bangladeshi market, combining a customer-facing storefront and a full admin management panel in one project.
- **Primary stack:** Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19, Tailwind CSS 3.4, Prisma 5 + PostgreSQL. All code is JSX (no TypeScript). Admin panel uses plain React + Tailwind (ShadCN is not used in practice).
- **Status:** MVP feature-complete and deployed to Vercel. Payment gateway integration is not implemented yet (orders are confirmed manually via phone/WhatsApp).

## Goals
- Browse categories and products with fast discovery (live search, category hierarchy, sorting/filtering)
- Product pages with image gallery, variant selection (size/color), and accurate pricing/discount display
- Add-to-cart with variant support and localStorage-persisted cart + wishlist
- Guest checkout flow with BD phone validation, shipping area selection, and Bangladesh-specific delivery charges
- Order placement safeguards: device fingerprinting, blocked-device rejection, duplicate-order prevention, Telegram alerts
- Admin UI for products/variants, categories, orders, blog CMS, site settings, and DB backup/restore
- SEO-friendly pages: dynamic sitemap, robots.txt, per-page metadata, Open Graph image generation, JSON-LD structured data
- GTM analytics with SPA page-view tracking

## Regional Focus
- This application is designed for Bangladeshi customers and sellers.
- Currency is always Bangladeshi Taka (BDT); do not support USD or other currencies.
- Checkout includes fields: name, mobile, address, shipping_area, and delivery charge selection.
- Delivery charge options: inside Dhaka = 50 taka, outside Dhaka = 120 taka.
- Content is bilingual where relevant (English UI, Bengali product/blog content).
