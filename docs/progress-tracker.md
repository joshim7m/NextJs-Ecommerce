## Key Blockers & Decisions

### Resolved Decisions
- **Auth:** Custom JWT via `jose` + `proxy.js` (Next 16 middleware replacement) — not NextAuth
- **Image storage:** Local uploads to `public/uploads/` + remote URLs for seeded data
- **Dark mode:** Implemented in both storefront and admin
- **UI library:** ShadCN dropped; plain React + Tailwind throughout
- **Product data:** Real scraped catalog from eghuri.com (not dummy data)

### Current Blockers
- None blocking development.

### Pending Decisions
- Payment gateway choice (bKash/Nagag/card) and timeline
- Customer accounts (registration/login) — currently guest-only checkout
- Bengali localization of UI chrome
- Error tracking service (Sentry or similar)

---

## Next Steps

1. Commit the Backup DB feature (`app/admin/settings/backup-db/`, `app/api/admin/backup/`, sidebar/layout changes)
2. Re-enable or remove the AnnouncementBar in Header
3. Payment gateway integration (Phase 3)
4. Set up test framework + CI pipeline
5. Customer accounts & order history

---

## Legend

- ✅ **Done:** Task completed and verified
- ⏳ **In Progress / Partial:** Being worked on or incomplete
- ⚠️ **Built, disabled:** Implemented but turned off
- ❌ **Not Started:** Ready to begin
